I would like to thank my director, Domingo Gómez Pérez, for all the time and help he gave me during the development of this work. His patience, friendlyness and commitment made the time we spent together really enjoyable. He has been both a tutor and a friend to me, a friend to remember and preserve.\\


I would also like to thank my friends from the Masters's Degree in Data Science for all the time we spent during this year. I'm really happy I shared that time with them and I hope there's more to come.\\


Finally, I would like to thank my family for all the love and support they've given me. All their work and effort made it possible for me to get here, and I'll always be grateful for that.\\
